# cs101Project03
In this project we were to create a contact book. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with linked lists. We were to make a contact list that could store contacts and a list of their info. We were to make various functions in the contact list that I will describe below.

# Add Contact and Add Info
AddContact and AddInfo functions were supposed to just append the contact into the linked list and its info. If AddInfo was called, the new piece of information was to be appended to the end of the info list.

# Print and PrintContact
The Print function was to print the whole contact list and the PrintContact was to print the contact and its info.

# AddContactOrdered and AddInfoOrdered
AddContactOrdered and AddInfoOrdered were to add contacts/info in alphabetically ascending order.

# RemoveContact and RemoveInfo
If RemoveContact was called, the contact and its info were to be cleared. If RemoveInfo was called, only the specific info was to be removed.

# Rule of 3
We were to implement the deep copy operator, the assignment operator, and the destructor for the ContactList. For some reason, my destructor did not work properly and failed the test case.
